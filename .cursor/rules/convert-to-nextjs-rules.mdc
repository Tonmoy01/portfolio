1. Project Structure
- Always use Next.js App Router with the `/app` directory.
- Every page must live in: /app/<route>/page.tsx
- Root layout: /app/layout.tsx
- Use nested layouts ONLY when necessary.
- Maintain a clear folder structure:
  /app
  /components
  /public/assets

2. Server Components by Default
- All components MUST be React Server Components unless absolutely required.
- Add `"use client"` ONLY when:
  • using useState, useEffect, useRef
  • accessing window or document
  • needing browser-only interactivity
  • using DOM-based 3rd-party libraries
- Never make a full page a client component unless unavoidable.

3. Component Architecture
- Break each HTML file into small, reusable components (Header, Footer, Card, Hero, etc.).
- Use PascalCase for component and folder names.
- Organize components inside:
  /components/<Group>/<ComponentName>.tsx
- Components must be single-responsibility and clean.


4. Styling Rules
- Use Tailwind CSS by default for all styling.
- Convert HTML classes and inline styles into equivalent Tailwind utilities.
- Maintain the original design, spacing, colors, and responsive behavior when translating to Tailwind.
- If a section cannot be accurately recreated with Tailwind:
    → Use a CSS Module for that specific component only.
- If global layout or fonts require it:
    → Add minimal global CSS in app/globals.css.
- Avoid unnecessary custom CSS—prefer Tailwind utilities.
- Do NOT change:
  • colors
  • spacing
  • layout
  • font usage

5. Asset Handling
- Move all images, icons, and static files to `/public/assets`.
- Fix paths:
  "images/img.png" → "/assets/img.png"
- Use <Image> only when optimization is desired; <img> allowed for pixel-perfect matching.


6. Routing & Navigation
- Convert internal <a> → <Link href="/path">.
- External links remain <a>, with:
  • target="_blank"
  • rel="noopener noreferrer"

7. Interactivity (Client Components Only When Needed)
- Only wrap interactive areas inside small "client" components:
    FormClient, DropdownClient, ModalClient, etc.
- Keep static UI in server components.
- Do NOT convert full pages into client components.

8. Accessibility & Semantics
- Preserve semantic HTML (header, nav, main, section, footer).
- Ensure all images include descriptive alt text.
- Improve accessibility where missing.

9. Tailwind Conversion Guidelines
- Match the original HTML design pixel-for-pixel using Tailwind classes.
- Preserve:
  • spacing
  • colors
  • breakpoints
  • typography
  • grid/flex layout
- If Tailwind cannot replicate a style accurately:
    → Create a CSS Module for that specific component.


10. Output Requirements
- Always provide the complete file tree for the transformed code.
- Code must run with:
  npm run dev  OR  pnpm dev
- Include:
  • .tsx component files
  • Tailwind styling
  • Optional .module.css only when needed
  • Updated asset paths
- Add a README describing:
  - project structure
  - how to run
  - where custom styles (if any) are stored


11. Code Quality Standards
- Use TypeScript unless user requests JavaScript.
- Keep components clean, readable, and well-structured.
- Avoid unnecessary abstraction or refactoring.
- Prefer composition over complexity.
- Try not to use any as type interface

12. HTML → Next.js Conversion Rules
- Keep the design identical to the original HTML.
- Split repeated parts into components using Tailwind.
- Translate inline/HTML styling → Tailwind utilities.
- Maintain original responsive behavior.


13. Steps for Converting Each HTML File
    1. Create a Next.js page at: /app/<route>/page.tsx  
    2. Move images → /public/assets  
    3. Convert HTML → Tailwind-based components  
    4. Extract reusable parts: Header, Footer, Card, Hero, etc.  
    5. Add CSS Modules only when Tailwind cannot reproduce a style  
    6. Wrap interactive elements inside minimal client components  
    7. Provide final file tree + complete code
